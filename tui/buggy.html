              Probably the most unique of CMU's tradition, buggy has evolved from friends pushing eachother up and down roads in shopping carts to what is likely the largest attended "sporting event" at the school. Taking place during spring carnival, buggy involves a team of 5 "pushers" that help propel a carbon fiber torpedo-style vehicle around the hills of Schenley Park, ajoint to campus. Inside the buggy is a driver, usually a female under 5 foot in height, that stears the vehicle around the various turns of the course.

              As a head mechanic this past year, my roles on the team were to make sure the vehicles were in a safe opporating condition, checking things like bearings, brake lines, and wheel conditions. Although simple in concept, the tradition of buggy has become so competitive as to create a veil of secrecy around the success of each of the teams, with things like wheel composites and stearing technologies not showcased to the public (so I can't go into too too much detail here). Overall, teams spend thousands of dollars every year on these buggies, so it is certainly not taken lightly.

              I really enjoy working with Buggy as something completely outside of my usual domain of software engineering. It allowed me to work hands on with some really cool technologies, including doing layups of carbon fiber molds and heated composite wheels. Along with several other members of my organization, we accomplished getting one of our formerly crashed buggy back on the road for the first time in 3 years as well as 4th overall time in a pool of over 30 teams.

              In addition, I was also fortunate to get to work on some designs for several aspects of my Buggy team. Firstly, I got to work on a new paint job on a newly rebuilt buggy. I had thought of several different directions I could take the project, but eventially decided on some variation of the following:

            </center>
            <p>
              This is a type of project I've never really had the chance to finish before and it was an extremely fulfilling experience.
              I also tasked myself with designing the team raceday apparel, another aspect of the tradition of the buggy teams. For inspiration, I looked at our teams fastest buggy, kraken's, design scheme.

            <p>
              The design was so well received, we ended up getting the award for best t-shirt design from the overall buggy committee.

              Although not inherently applicable to my professional career goals, I found being a part of the CMU Buggy tradition to be one of the most fulfilling things I've been fortunate to be a part of in my life.
