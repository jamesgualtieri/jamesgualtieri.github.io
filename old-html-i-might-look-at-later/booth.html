                There's something inherently strange about dozens of organizations constructing a 1 or 2 story wooden structure within a week then after only 3 days tearing it down and cleaning up the build site as if none of it ever happened. To me, however, the tradition of Booth has been one of my most fulfilling experiences as a member of the Carnegie Mellon Community.

                Although not particularly practical, there's something magical about the idea of creating a little building around some theme, and having an entire "Midway" of connected buildings really adds to this concept. In my sophomore year, myself and a <a href="http://briswalsh.com" style="text-shadow: 0 0 2px #FFC23C" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#0FF'" onMouseOut="this.style.color='#FFC23C'"> friend </a> had taken up being the ones in charge of our organization's booth building effort. The overarching theme for Spring Carnival was decided to be a "Timehop," and thus we couldn't help but be drawn to theme our booth around a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...

                Having chosen Star Wars, we then had to figure out a design for the building that would both help get accross our theme as well as be a practical structure to fulfill all the construction requirements of the booth tradition. For topicality at the time, we chose to focus on the most recent of the films, and began the design process.

                We wanted something reconizable, yet not to plain that it wouldn't stand out. The above are the initial design concept and final design for the structure. Thankfully, we had members in our orgnaization that were experienced with using the sofware necessary to create building plans that conformed to the construction standards. But this step is just the beginning of the lengthy process of booth.

                With 2 levels of platforms, walls, a roof, and multiple decorative structures, there was a lot of building that still needed to be done. From a shear labor process, that is a daunting enough task. Coupled with the need to maintain the budget necessary to make sure we didn't overspend. In addition, there are things that go inside the structure, to add to the themed nature of the project, including a <a href="http://www.ricardotucker.com/jakku.html" style="text-shadow: 0 0 2px #FFC23C" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#0FF'" onMouseOut="this.style.color='#FFC23C'"> game </a>- another staple of the CMU Carnival Booth.

                Given that we are given exactly 6 days to assemble the booth, the week of build can be quite hectic. Although, as someone who studies software engineering, I find the idea of getting to do a more physical construction of things to be quite enjoyable.

                There were many struggles along the way, including issues of extreme weather conditions, shifts in focus, and issues in organization participation, but eventually the structure was completed.

                Although an arduous process, the experience of being a booth chairman was probably the most extreme case of project management I've ever endured. And though not tangentially related to my field of study, I've learned many lessons that I would like have not otherwise in my time as a booth chairman.

                And getting a first place trophy didn't feel too bad either :)
