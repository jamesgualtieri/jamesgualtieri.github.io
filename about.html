My technical interests include Computer Graphics and Animation
and Cyber Security I really enjoy the intersection of technology with other industries, specifically
in the entertainment sector.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm actively involved in a lot of the things on CMU's campus. I really enjoy the 
			being a part of the things that make CMU unique. I've been a 
			head mechanic for <a href="buggy.html" class="plain">buggy</a> as well as being
			in charge of a <a href="booth.html" class="plain">booth</a>. I enjoy being able to 
			work on things that aren't always directly related to my field of study.
		</p>
		<p>
Outside of working with software, I enjoy film, playing video games, and keeping up 
with sports when I can. I've lived most of my live in Pittsburgh, but I like to travel
and experience nature and National Parks. While I don't have a lot of experience doing so,
I very much enjoy working with graphic design as well as 3D modeling.
