        Face Race was a group project I worked on as the Final Project for my <a href="cgp.html"> Computer Game Programming </a> class. The basic premise of the game was to manipulate a character's face to allow the player react to situations and give the character proper facial reactions.
        <br />
        <p>
        As the rest of the class, the game is written from scratch using C++ for engine and OpenGL/GLSL for graphics. The project also involved creating Shape Keys for the character mesh, which was done using Blender. This also involved being able to export the weights from the shapekeys using a python script, and subsequently import the weights into the application to allow for programmatic manipulation of the weights of the keys. The gameplay involves using the grab points to manipulate the shape keys and create the indicated facial expressions on the User Interface based on the prompts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Also implemented on the game is environment based lighting and a rim shader on the character, done using OpenGL and GLSL.
